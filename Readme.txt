Student Class Python Code
Overview
This Python code defines a robust Student class that encapsulates essential student information with a focus on object-oriented programming principles. It includes features such as encapsulation, constructor overloading, instance methods, class methods, and access modifiers.

Key Features
Encapsulation: The class encapsulates student details, providing a clean interface for accessing and modifying attributes.

Constructor Overloading: The __init__ constructor is designed to handle various parameterizations, allowing flexibility during object creation.

Instance Methods:

Getter and setter methods (getFirstName, setFirstName, getLastName, setLastName, getAge, setAge) provide controlled access to attributes with validation.
tellMeAboutYourself method prints a formatted summary of the student.
Class Method:

getTotalObj is a class method to retrieve and print the total number of student objects created.
Usage Example
python
Copy code
# Create student objects
s1 = Student("James", "Jones", 22)
s1.tellMeAboutYourself()

s2 = Student("Shelly", "Williams", 25)
s2.tellMeAboutYourself()

# Modify student attributes
s2.setLastName = " "
s2.setAge = 2500
s2.tellMeAboutYourself()

# Other student objects...

# Get total number of student objects
Student.getTotalObj()
Design Patterns
The code incorporates the State Design Pattern for managing the state of student objects. This pattern enables objects to alter their behavior when their internal state changes, promoting flexibility in handling different scenarios.

File Structure
student.py: Contains the Student class definition.

main.py: Demonstrates the usage of the Student class with various scenarios.
